    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, I’m Jinwook from South Korea. My major was philosophy but I’m switching to IT. I really enjoyed studying philosophy but feel I was born in the wrong era—I should’ve been born in ancient Greece. I also shoot and edit videos as a side project and have 23k followers on TikTok.
